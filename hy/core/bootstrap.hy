     #[[the defmacro macro
     ``defmacro`` is used to define macros. The general format is
     ``(defmacro name [parameters] expr)``.

     The following example defines a macro that can be used to swap order of elements
     in code, allowing the user to write code in infix notation, where operator is in
     between the operands.

     Examples:
       ::

          => (defmacro infix [code]
          ...  (quasiquote (
          ...    (unquote (get code 1))
          ...    (unquote (get code 0))
          ...    (unquote (get code 2)))))

       ::

          => (infix (1 + 1))
          2

     The name of the macro can be given as a string literal instead of a symbol. If the name starts with `#`, the macro can be called on a single argument without parentheses; such a macro is called a tag macro.

       ::

          => (defmacro "#x2" [form]
          ...  `(do ~form ~form))

       ::

          => (setv foo 1)
          => #x2 (+= foo 1)
          => foo
          3
     ]]
     (if (not (isinstance macro-name (, hy.models.Symbol hy.models.String)))
          (raise
            (hy.errors.HyTypeError
              (% "received a `hy.models.%s' instead of a symbol or string for macro name"
                 (. (type macro-name) __name__))
              None __file__ None)))
     (if (in "." macro-name)

            (raise (hy.errors.HyTypeError "macros cannot use '*', or '#**'"

(defmacro macro-error [expression reason [filename '__name__]]

(defmacro defn/a [name lambda-list #* body]
  "Define `name` as a function with `lambda-list` signature and body `body`.

  ``defn/a`` macro is a variant of ``defn`` that instead defines
  coroutines. It takes three parameters: the *name* of the function to
  define, a vector of *parameters*, and the *body* of the function:

  Examples:
    ::

       => (defn/a name [params] body)
  "
